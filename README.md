# Pattern-Recognition
This repository is an example of Pattern Recognition for financial time series data. In this case, for Stock Market Analysis using the AGIO dataset.
This code employs various algorithmic pattern recognition techniques to identify specific configurations in stock price and volume data.
Here is how it is implemented:
1) Feature Engineering for Pattern Recognition (calculate_indicators function)
2) Explicit Pattern Identification (identify_crosses function)
3) Volume-Based Pattern Recognition (calculate_obv function)
4) Candlestick Pattern Recognition (detect_candlestick_patterns function)
5) Visualization as a Tool for Human Pattern Recognition (plot_patterns function)

Finally, an explicit visualization of the price, MAs, Bollinger Bands, and marking the detected Golden/Death crosses and candlestick patterns.

Example of use:
- A trader can look at the chart and see if these detected patterns align with other observations or fundamental analysis.
